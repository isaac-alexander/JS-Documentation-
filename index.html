            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language.
                Inside a host environment(for example, a web browswer), JavaScript can be connected to the objects
                of
                its
                environment to provide programatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for
                a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                    its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements
                    on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.
                </li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                    JavaScript
                    on
                    a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database,
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform
                    file
                    manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What you should already know</h2>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on
                    the
                    main
                    page about JavaScript.</li>

            <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows
                most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason
                why
                it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's comple-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtimo
                system based on a small number of data types ropresenting numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript
                has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototypo-based
                modol providos dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                JavaScript
                also supports functions without any spocial declarative requiromonts. Functions can be properties of
                objects, executing as loosoly typed mothods.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes,
                and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected,
                and
                you
                do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
                explicitly
                typed.</p>

        <div id="hello-world">
            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <div class="function">
                <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</p>
                <p>greetMe("World");</p>
